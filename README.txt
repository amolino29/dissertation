This GitHub folder is for Andrea Molino's dissertation. 

- Generally, data are being stored in Andrea's OneDrive, and code is being stored on Git for tracking and storage purposes. This is mainly for protection of the data and because some of the data sources are too large to be stored on Git (such as the BRFSS ASCII files and some of the geocoded data)
- Code is generally split up by Aim, but there are some additional folders as needed
