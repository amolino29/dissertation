I didn't write this into the analytical plan as to not add complications or slow down the data obtaining process. 

I would like to do one other analysis in this aim, specifically, investigating if within the direct-mail and opt-in arms, if participants were more likely to decide to use HPV SS compared to the in-clinic option vs. no screening, that kind of thing. Still need to think about what is the most valid comparator. I think it would be comparing the % HPV SS vs. % in-clinic vs. % no screening in the low SES tracts, compared to the % HPV SS vs. % in-clinic vs. % no screening in the low SES tracts. 

I will have all the data needed for this, as long as I have the stratification of the outcome in the HPV SS option groups!
